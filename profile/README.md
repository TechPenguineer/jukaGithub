## Use For Any Project
Juka can be used for all types of projects including server side coding, client side coding, native coding, web development, API development, data science, network security, and quantum computing.


## Run on Any Device
At the current stage, Juka is interpreted. However, we are concurrently working on a Compiler (JIT). Juka's main goal is to be able to run on any platform including:
Windows, MacOS, Linux, MS Azure, FreeBSD, Raspberry Pi, Unity, Jupyter Kernel, C# dll, iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows App, MacOS App, etc.
