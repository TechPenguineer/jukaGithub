## üë®‚Äçüíª Portable
Juka doesn't need to be installed! That means you can run Juka in environments where you don't have admin privileges or in environments where you don't have access to a hard drive. Juka is completely standalone and doesn't require any other application or any other dependency to be installed. Run it on your Flash/Thumb Drive!

## ü§è Small in Size
Juka is fairly small in size ~ 30 mb (depending on the OS). This means that you can put Juka on your Thumb/Flash Drive. In fact, why not put all versions of Juka on your Thumb/Flash Drive? It won't take much space anyways.

## üêç Jupyter Support
We know a lot of people love to use Jupyter Notebook/Lab. We've added an easy way to run Juka (kernel) in Jupyter. Do your data analysis in the software that you are used to!
