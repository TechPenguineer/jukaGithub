## Use For Any Project
Juka can be used for all types of projects including server side coding, client side coding, native coding, web development, API development, data science, network security, and quantum computing.


## Run on Any Device
At the current stage, Juka is interpreted. However, we are concurrently working on a Compiler (JIT). Juka's main goal is to be able to run on any platform including:
Windows, MacOS, Linux, MS Azure, FreeBSD, Raspberry Pi, C# dll
Coming Soon:
iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows App, MacOS App.

## Cloud Friendly
You can run Juka on Microsoft's Azure Server by using Juka's Azure serverless function. Compile the code quickly, or let the others run the code. Download latest Azure Function from https://jukalang.com/download.
NOTE: you need an active Microsoft Azure account to host.

## Get Packages from a Blockchain
All Juka packages/libraries are hosted on a blockchain in a decentralized manner. Want to help with running the network? Add your server configuration to https://github.com/jukaLang/juka-network and run the Juka-Network Server (which can be downloaded from https://github.com/jukaLang/juka-network/releases). We appreciate any help!
